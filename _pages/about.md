<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 23-Fall PhD student in the [Department of Information Systems](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/is/research/introduction.html) in the School of Business at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Ben Liu](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/qianqliu/). I just graduated from [South China University of Technology](https://cnsba.scut.edu.cn/) with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering.


My research focuses on patient (especially elderly) **well-being in technology-enabled healthcare**, two specific areas of which may be **online healthcare communities** and **human-AI interaction**. 
I am passionate about empirical research (both survey and secondary data) with an emphasis on **credible causal inference** and **behavioral decision theory**, and am also interested in incorporating lab experiments and game theory insights into my research.
